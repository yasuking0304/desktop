  // The following types are part of the WebWorker support in Node.js and are a

  // https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20756, and
  // https://github.com/dexie/Dexie.js/pull/1577.

  // We've upgraded Dexie already but react-dom is a bigger beast and we don't
  // need any of them to run our tests so we just delete them here. In fact,
