## What is this repository for?

This repository contains specific patches on top of the upstream
`desktop/desktop` repository to support Linux usage.

It also hosts preview packages for various Linux distributions:

 - AppImage (`.AppImage`)
 - Debian (`.deb`)
 - RPM (`.rpm`)

Check out the [latest releases](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases) to
help out with testing on your distribution.

## Repositories

You can use your operating system's package manager to install `github-desktop` and
keep it up to date on Debian/RPM based distributions. There are two options for this:

* A [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/) repository with excellent global connectivity
  but very limited bandwidth. This option will stop working each month when the bandwidth
  limit is reached.
* A [mirror](https://mattwthomas.com/mirrors/) in the US which has effectively infinite
  bandwidth and performs well in most regions (especially the Americas and Europe).

PackageCloud, which both options depend on, is not a free service. So, if you can afford to
help with these costs please [**Sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/shiftkey) the project
using the link in the header.

### Debian/Ubuntu distributions

First install our GPG certificate:

```sh
$ wget -qO - https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/gpgkey | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/shiftkey-desktop.asc > /dev/null
```

To setup the package repository, run one of these commands:

```sh
# if you want to use packagecloud.io
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/any/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/packagecloud-shiftkey-desktop.list'

# if you want to use the US mirror
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/deb/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/packagecloud-shiftkey-desktop.list'
```

Then install GitHub Desktop:

```sh
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install github-desktop
```

### Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora distributions

First install our GPG certificate:

```sh
$ sudo rpm --import https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/gpgkey
```

To setup the package repository, run one of these commands:

```sh
# if you want to use packagecloud.io
$ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/el/7/\$basearch\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=0\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/gpgkey" > /etc/yum.repos.d/shiftkey-desktop.repo'

# if you want to use the US mirror
$ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/rpm\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=0\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/gpgkey" > /etc/yum.repos.d/shiftkey-desktop.repo'
```

Then install GitHub Desktop:

```sh
# if yum is your package manager
$ sudo yum install github-desktop

# if dnf is your package manager
$ sudo dnf install github-desktop
```

### OpenSUSE distribution


First install our GPG certificate:

```sh
$ sudo rpm --import https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/gpgkey
```

To setup the package repository, run one of these commands:

```sh
# if you want to use packagecloud.io
$ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/el/7/\$basearch\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=0\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/gpgkey" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/shiftkey-desktop.repo'

# if you want to use the US mirror
$ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/rpm\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=0\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://mirror.mwt.me/ghd/gpgkey" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/shiftkey-desktop.repo'
```

Then install GitHub Desktop:

```sh
# if zypper is your package manager
$ sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in github-desktop
```

## Other Distributions

Arch Linux users can install GitHub Desktop from the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/github-desktop-bin/).

`gnome-keyring` is required and the daemon must be launched either at login or when the X server is started. Normally this is handled by a display manager, but in other cases following the instructions found on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring_outside_GNOME) will fix the issue of not being able to save login credentials.

GitHub Desktop is also available cross-platform as a [Flatpak](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.shiftey.Desktop) and [AppImage](https://appimage.github.io/GitHubDesktop/).

## Known issues
