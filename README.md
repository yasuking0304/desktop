## What is this repository for?

This repository contains specific patches on top of the upstream
`desktop/desktop` repository to support Linux usage.

It also hosts preview packages for various Linux distributions:

 - AppImage (`.AppImage`)
 - Debian (`.deb`)
 - RPM (`.rpm`)

Check out the [latest releases](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases) to
help out with testing on your distribution.

## packagecloud

We use [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/) for distributing
the installers for Debian and RPM-based distributions. These are not free services,
so if you can afford to help with these costs please [**Sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/shiftkey)
the project using the link in the header.

### Debian/Ubuntu distributions

To setup the package repository, run these commands:

```sh
$ wget -qO - https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/gpgkey | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/shiftkey-desktop.asc > /dev/null
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/any/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/packagecloud-shiftkey-desktop.list'
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Then install GitHub Desktop:

```sh
$ sudo apt install github-desktop
```

### Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora distributions

To setup the package repository, run these commands:

```sh
$ sudo rpm --import https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/gpgkey
$ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/el/7/\$basearch\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=0\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/gpgkey" > /etc/yum.repos.d/shiftkey-desktop.repo'
```

Then install GitHub Desktop:

```sh
# if yum is your package manager
$ sudo yum install github-desktop

# if dnf is your package manager
$ sudo dnf install github-desktop
```

### OpenSUSE distribution
```sh
$ sudo rpm --import https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/gpgkey
$ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/el/7/\$basearch\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=0\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packagecloud.io/shiftkey/desktop/gpgkey" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/shiftkey-desktop.repo'
```

Then install GitHub Desktop:

```sh
# if zypper is your package manager
$ sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in github-desktop
```

## Other Distributions

Arch Linux users can install GitHub Desktop from the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/github-desktop-bin/).

`gnome-keyring` is required and the daemon must be launched either at login or when the X server is started. Normally this is handled by a display manager, but in other cases following the instructions found on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring_outside_GNOME) will fix the issue of not being able to save login credentials.

## Known issues

If you're having troubles with Desktop, please refer to the [Known issues](docs/known-issues.md#linux)
document for guidance and workarounds for common limitations.
